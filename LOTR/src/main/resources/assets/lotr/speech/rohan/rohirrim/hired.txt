For Rohan! For our people!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together!
Let us fight together for the Riddermark, #!
For the Riddermark!
Our enemies shall be brought to ruin!
We shall earn much glory on the field of battle together, #.
The foes of Rohan shall tremble where they stand!
We ride out together. For glory. For Rohan!

Filthy maggot! Oh, it's you, #...
I seek man-flesh!
Where is the man-flesh?
What do you want?
You still don't look like a goblin-man, #!
I've had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days!
Maggoty bread again? Give me some man-flesh!
I can't wait to get my teeth into some man-flesh!
At your service, #!
Soon, #! Soon we will be at war with the filthy sons of men!
What are you after?
The air is foul here.
We serve a common master, #.
We shall break their bones and feast on their flesh!
Death to the kingdoms of men! Death to the filthy elves!
We shall swarm into the lands of the free peoples like a plague! Leave nothing alive!
What orders from our lord, #?
These rags stink!
The world of men shall be broken and destroyed.
Ruin! Ruin to the free peoples!
Something smells disgusting here. It's you, #! Go away!

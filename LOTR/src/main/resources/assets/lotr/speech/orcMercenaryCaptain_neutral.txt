You think I'd sell mercenaries to scum like you? Ha!
Only the foulest of men can command orcs, #.
Work some more evil, and then perhaps I'll consider trading units with you.
Come back when you've proven your worth, maggot.
I'm not selling any orcs to you until you kill some more filthy enemies!
The orcs of Mordor would never follow a weakling like you, #!

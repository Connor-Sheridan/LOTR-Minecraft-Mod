Welcome, #. What brings you to the land of Rohan?
What business do you have in the Riddermark, #?
Welcome to Rohan, #.
The world of men has fallen from its former glory.
I hope to see the world of men restored, as it was in the days of old.
These lands are troubled, #. Uruk-hai often break through our borders.
Ever we must rid our lands of the orc filth that plagues us, #.
Welcome to Rohan. From which land do you hail?
Hail, #! We are the riders of Rohan.
These are the lands of our fathers, and our fathers' fathers. It is our duty to guard them.
The horses of Rohan are the finest in all Middle-earth.
Beware the Uruk-hai. They come here often in raiding parties, leaving only destruction in their wake.
New life grows ever where the forefathers of Rohan sleep.
The wolf that one hears is worse than the orc that one fears.

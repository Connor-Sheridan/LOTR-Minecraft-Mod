Do you have any silver coins, friend?
My pockets are overflowing with precious minerals!
Ripe meat off the bone! I'd pay a hefty sum of silver for some of that...
Have you any ale, #?
Are you willing to trade, #?
I'd pay handsomely for a good drink!
By Durin's beard, I'm starving!
Desire you to trade, #?
I have many precious minerals to offer you.
We dwarves enjoy a nice cut of juicy meat!
By my beard, I get hungry down here in the mines!

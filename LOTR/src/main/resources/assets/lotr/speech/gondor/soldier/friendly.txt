Welcome to Gondor.
Welcome to Gondor, #.
We are truth-speakers, we Men of Gondor.
I long to see a king on the throne of Gondor again.
These are dark times. A great power is rising in the east.
I am a knight of Gondor.
I hope to see the glory of Gondor restored someday.
Gondor is not as great as it once was.
It is a shame you could not have come to Gondor in happier days, #.
Welcome, #. What business brings you to Gondor?

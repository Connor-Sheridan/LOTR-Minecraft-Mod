You may go no further. You will not enter Gondor!
Sons of Gondor! Hold your ground!
You may not enter Gondor, #!
For Gondor!
You are an enemy of the throne of Gondor, #!
Enemies have entered Gondor!
By the White Tree, I will see you slain!
I swear to Gondor that your death shall be swift!
Your death shall be swift, #!
This is a fell hour for Gondor indeed!
No pity for the foes of Gondor!

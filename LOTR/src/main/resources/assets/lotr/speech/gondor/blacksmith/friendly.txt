Want some equipment? Bring me silver coins.
Welcome, #! What can I forge for you?
Materials for equipment are always in short supply.
I see you are a friend of Gondor, #.
Might you be seeking some fine Gondorian equipment, #?
I'm still looking for an apprentice...
I forge the best weaponry in all of Gondor!

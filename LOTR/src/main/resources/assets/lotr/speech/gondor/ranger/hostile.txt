Your death shall come swift as the arrow that pierces, #!
I shall make an end of you!
You are not welcome in the land of Gondor!
Flee our lands, you scoundrel!
You are an enemy of the Men of Gondor, #!
What madness led you here?
Crawl back to the shadows from whence you came, #!
You thought you could match our skill? You are sorely mistaken!
When did # forsake reason for madness?
Your doom approaches, #!
Do not underestimate the Men of Gondor.

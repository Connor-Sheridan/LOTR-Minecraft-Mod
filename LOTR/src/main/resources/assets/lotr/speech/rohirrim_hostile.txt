We Rohirrim shall not suffer your presence in these lands, #!
I shall not suffer your presence here!
You are not welcome in the Mark, #!
You should have fled these lands long ago!
Tremble where you stand, #!
It was foolish indeed of you to venture into our lands!
Your doom shall come swiftly, #!
No pity for the foes of Rohan!

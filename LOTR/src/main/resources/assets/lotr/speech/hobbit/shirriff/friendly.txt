Good day to you!
Good day, #!
Have you seen any troublemakers round here?
I protect these lands as best I can, #.
Is it time for second breakfast yet?
I can't wait to get back to my Hobbit hole. Warm food and comfort!
Let me know if you see anything troublesome.
As long as I'm on duty, may the hair on your toes never fall out!
I haven't eaten for at least an hour.
The lack of food is the worst thing about being on duty, #.
If I get promoted, I'll be able to ride a real horse!
With us Shirriffs keeping the Shire safe, you've nothing to worry about!
Have you seen any mischief around these parts, #?
It's my duty to put a stop to mischief, wherever I see it!

Hello there, mister #!
Am I doing my job well, mister #?
Po-ta-toes! Boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em in a stew...
I ain't been dropping no eaves, mister #, I swear!
We Hobbits of the Shire are the best farmers in all Middle-earth!
And how are you today, mister #?
I can't wait to get back to work!
A day spent on the fields is a good day indeed, mister #.
It's almost harvest time!

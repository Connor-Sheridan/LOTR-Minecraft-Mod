Good day, #. Have I seen you around these parts before?
If you're looking to hire Shirriffs, you'll have to earn a bit of prestige first.
You're looking to hire my Shirriffs? Firstly, you're one of the Big Folk, and secondly, I haven't even heard of you!
Good day, #.
You don't look like you're from around these parts, #.
How are things in the Shire today, #?
You shan't be hiring any of my Shirriffs until I know I can trust you a bit more!
And what are you after, #? You'll have to prove I can trust you if you want to hire my Shirriffs.
Don't worry, I'm supposed to be in this here tavern... yes, I'm off-duty. Yes, that's it.
Even us Shirriff Chiefs have to have some time off, #!
No, I'm not drunk, #. Not drunk at all.
This ale is delicious! Oh - what do you want?
How long have I been in this tavern, you ask? Well that's none of your business!

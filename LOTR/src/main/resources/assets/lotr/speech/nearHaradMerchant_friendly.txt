We traders of Harad are well travelled, and for all that, we have many goods to sell you.
Fantastic treasures from the ends of the earth, for just a few silver coins!
Any valuable resources to sell, #? I shall offer you a very fair price.
I carry rare treasures such as have never before been seen in the north!

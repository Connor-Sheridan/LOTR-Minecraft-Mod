I shall be returning south before long, so come trade while you still can!
Soon I shall be crossing the Great Desert, and my wares with me.
Time is short, but trades are ever bountiful!
I will be on my way soon. Any last trades?
The gifts of Haradwaith do not long linger in the North.
Last chance! Come and trade for the goods of the South!
I still have many goods left to sell. Hurry, hurry!
If you do not buy the treasures of Harad now, the chance may never come again!

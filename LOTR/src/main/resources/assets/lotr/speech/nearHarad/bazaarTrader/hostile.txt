You have travelled all this way, but it is for naught. I will not trade with an enemy of Harad!
If the Men of Gondor are your allies, you are my enemy, #!
You made a bad choice in traversing the desert to the lands of Harad.
I shall not trade my wares or silver with you. Sell your wretched goods elsewhere!
The silver of Harad will not ever find its way into your hands, #!
There is nothing for the likes of you to buy!

Fish, fish, fish! Sméagol likes nice slimy fish...
What does it want, precious?
Sméagol doesn't trust this one.
Never thirsty, ever drinking, all in mail never clinking...
Who is it, precious? Why does it come looking for us?
Does it want to play games?
To catch a fish, so juicy sweet...
We wants it! We needs it! They stole it from us!
We likes goblinses and fishes, but we've never tried # before, precious!

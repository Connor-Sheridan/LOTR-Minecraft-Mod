Any enemy of Rohan is a friend of Dunland!
We have sworn vengeance on the people of Rohan. Will you fight with us, #?
Our lands were taken by the Strawheads of Rohan.
We Dunlendings are a proud and vicious race.
Death to the men of Rohan!
Our feud with the thieving Rohirrim is centuries old.
Do you fight with us, #?
The land of Rohan should by rights be ours. Those filthy, strawheaded men of the River have no claim to it!
If the horse-lords are your enemy, #, then we welcome you into our land.
What do you want?

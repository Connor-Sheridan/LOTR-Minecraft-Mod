By Elbereth, I swear I shall see you slain!
You are not welcome in L贸rien!
You are not welcome in L贸rien, #!
You may not set foot in Lothl贸rien!
Flee these lands, #!
For Lothl贸rien!
Perish, you Morgul-demon!
No longer shall you darken these lands, #!
I swear by the Valar, I shall put an end to your evil!

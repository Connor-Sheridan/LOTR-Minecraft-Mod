Welcome to the Blue Mountains, #!
You're not a Firebeard, or a Broadbeam...
Greetings!
One day I'll be able to drink dwarven ale. I can't wait!
Even my mother's beard is better than yours, #!
Can you pass me some dwarven ale while nobody's looking?
How are you, #?
Raarrrgghh!
They say I'm too young to hunt orcs! Ha!
I wish I could wear my father's armour...
I will have a great beard one day!
There is no weapon finer than a dwarven axe, #!
One day I shall fight the evil orcs with my brothers!

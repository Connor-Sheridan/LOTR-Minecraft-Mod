You are foolish, young master #!
You, little one, are no friend of the Ents!
It seems I was right about your kind all along!
Hroom, hroom. How many of these trees have you slain, little one?
Hasty, but not hasty enough!
Burning, biting, snapping, splintering, killing... no more, young #!
No friend of the darkness in the east may enter Fangorn Forest!
One way or another, little hasty one, you shall leave Fangorn Forest!
There are other things beside trees that can be splintered, #!
Ent-enemy, tree-killer, your doom has caught up with you!
The forest is not your friend!

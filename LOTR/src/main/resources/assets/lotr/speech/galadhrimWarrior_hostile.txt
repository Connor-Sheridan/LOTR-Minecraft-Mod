By Elbereth, I swear I shall see you slain!
You are not welcome in Lórien!
You are not welcome in Lórien, #!
You may not set foot in Lothlórien!
Flee these lands, #!
For Lothlórien!
Perish, you Morgul-demon!
No longer shall you darken these lands, #!
I swear by the Valar, I shall put an end to your evil!
To Udûn with you!
Go and kiss an orc!
Death to the foes of the elves!
Who brings to us this token of doom?

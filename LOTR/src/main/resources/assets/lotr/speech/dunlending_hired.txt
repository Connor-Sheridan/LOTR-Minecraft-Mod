Death to the men of Rohan!
Death to the Strawheads!
Let us reclaim our homeland of old!
For wrath! For ruin! For our forefathers!
We shall roll into Rohan like a plague.
For Dunland!
Lead us to war, #!
We go to victory!
We Dunlendings are bold and strong warriors! We shall not fail you in battle!
Come, #! Let us together avenge my people!
It is time for the filthy Rohirrim to pay for their crimes!
We will fight for you!
The filthy strawheads shall fear our name! Lead us to war and triumph, #!

We Wood-elves will not fight for one so young as you, #.
No Elf of Mirkwood would follow your command.
Only the mightiest of Men are fit to command the warriors of Mirkwood, #.
You would seek to hire my warriors? Il√∫vatar has placed no bounds on the folly of Men.
You are no great warrior of the Elder Days, #, nor a Man of the West. Begone!
What foolishness makes you think an Elf of Mirkwood would follow your lead, #?
Great Men sometimes fight with us in battle. You are no great Man, #.
Which fool gave you passage into our lands?
I have yet to see any Adan of Endor capable of leading Elves, and you are no exception, #.

No evil may set foot in the Last Fair Realm!
You may not enter Lindon.
#, you may not set foot in Lindon!
You breathe so loudly I could have shot you in the dark.
You are unwelcome in our lands.
Your presence is unwelcome here.
You are no elf-friend, #!
The Enemy has no hold over Lindon!
You may not bring evil here, #!
Your darkness shall not poison the Last Fair Realm east of the Sea!

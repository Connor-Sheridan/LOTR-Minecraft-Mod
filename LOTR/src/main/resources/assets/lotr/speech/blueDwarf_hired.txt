I am proud to fight for your cause, #!
Let us go forth and slay some orcish scum!
My beard is itching for battle.
Our foes shall be crushed like a rack of fresh ribs!
The axes of the dwarves are sharpened for battle, #!
Few in Middle-earth can stand against the might of the dwarves of the Blue Mountains!
This is all well and good, but where has all the ale gone?
I'd sell my beard for a drink of dwarven ale.

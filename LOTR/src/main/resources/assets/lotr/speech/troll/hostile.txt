I'll 'ave your guts for garters!
You what?
You'd taste nice with a bit o' seasoning!
This one thinks 'e can outsmart us!
You're a clever little blighter, ain't you?
Shut your cake hole!
Come 'ere, you little wriggler!
You'd make a nice snack, you would!
You look scrumptious!
What's a #? Does it taste like chicken?
I wonder 'ow long it'd take to cook you!
This one's all skin an' bone!
You're a cheeky one!

Strange folk have been seen in these parts, and you look like one of them.
I hear you've been causing trouble round here.
You look like a troublemaker!
You look like a troublemaker, #.
Aren't you one of those strange folk I've heard talk of?
Stay away from the Shire, #.
Stay out of the Shire!
I shan't be lending you any of my pipeweed!
We don't take kindly to folk like you.
You're not a nice fellow, #.
There's talk of strange folk round here. Might you be one of them?
If you'll be begging my pardon, you make me feel uncomfortable.
You're one for the Mewlips, #!

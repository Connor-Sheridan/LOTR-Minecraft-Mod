Long have we guarded these lands, #.
We Rangers have watched over these lands for generations lost to memory.
What brings you to this wilderness, #?
May your journey be swift and your cloak warm, #.
By nightfall this land will be crawling with Orcs.
Be on your guard, #. There are many enemies in these parts.
Good day, #. From which land do you hail?
Keep a safe camp at night, and stay out of the shadows.
It is not for nothing that we watch these lands, #. Many foul beasts nest here.
We Rangers remember the ancient lore of the West. We have ways to walk unseen.
These lands are my domain, #, and I do all in my power to safeguard them.
Beware the wretched Morgul-scum that crawls out at night, #.
The wolf that one hears is worse than the Orc that one fears.

Greetings from the land of Lothlórien, #!
The fruits of Lórien may be bought for silver coins.
If you desire Elven crafts, I could exchange something for silver coins.
Do you wish to trade, #?
The sea calls me home, but I value silver coins as much as the next merchant.
Greetings, #. Perhaps you have something to trade?
I am an Elf of the Golden Wood.
I shall soon be leaving these shores.

Flee this forest, you Morgul-demon!
Return to the corruption from whence you came!
You are not welcome here, #!
You are no friend of the Elvenking!
Let's see you fight with an arrow in your flesh!
You should not have come here, #!
May you be consumed by the spiders of the Enemy!
Do not bring evil into our land, #!
Ha! You are no match for our bows and arrows!
To Ud√ªn with you!
Go and kiss an orc!
Death to the foes of the elves!
Who brings to us this token of doom?

We fight for the Woodland Realm!
You may be skilled in fighting, #, but even you cannot match our abilities.
Silver coins mean little to an elf. We have chosen to fight with you because it suits us, #.
Our foes shall fall and be trampled like the leaves of the forest!
Neither spider, orc filth, nor wicked man may stand against the power of Mirkwood!
For Mirkwood!
For the Woodland Realm! For the Elvenking!
My arrows shall be swift and my blade sharp as they seek the flesh of the enemy.
All foul things shall perish before the bows and blades of Mirkwood.
May the grace of the Valar protect us in combat, #.

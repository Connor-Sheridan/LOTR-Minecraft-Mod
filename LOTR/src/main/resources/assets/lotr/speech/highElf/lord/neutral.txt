Can we trust you, #?
If you wish to lead my Elves into battle, you must increase your standing among our people.
Only the greatest of Elf-friends may fight alongside us in battle.
No Elf would follow one as young in deeds as you into war, #.
Prove beyond doubt your allegiance to the Elves, #, and we will fight with you.
We Elves do not go idly to war, #.
You, #, would seek to command my warriors? By the Valar! Does the arrogance of Men know no end?

By the star of Eärendil, I swear I shall see you slain!
You are not welcome in Lindon!
You are not welcome in Lindon, #!
You may not set foot in this fair realm!
Flee these lands, #!
For Lindon!
Perish, you Morgul-demon!
No longer shall you darken these lands, #!
I swear by the Valar, I shall put an end to your evil!
To Udûn with you!
Go and kiss an orc!
Death to the foes of the elves!
Who brings to us this token of doom?

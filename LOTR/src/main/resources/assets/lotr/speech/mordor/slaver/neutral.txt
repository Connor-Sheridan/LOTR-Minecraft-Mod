Get back to work, scum! Mordor's armies ain't going to feed themselves!
A filthy maggot like you trying to hire some slaves? Hahaha!
Only the foulest of Men get to hire my slaves, #!
You want to hire my slaves? Is this a joke?
I'm not selling any slaves to the likes of you, maggot!
If you want to buy slaves from me, you'll have to do some more evil.
Are you a slave, or what?
Get back to work! Oh, you're not a slave? But you may as well be, scum!
You want to hire slaves from me? Bad joke, Man-scum!
Get back to work!
Those crops won't grow themselves!

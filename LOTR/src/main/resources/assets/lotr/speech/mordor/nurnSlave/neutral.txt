Must get back to work.
I fear the lash...
The Eye watches, always, always, always...
The great Eye is ever watchful, #.
Freedom? Ha! We have no freedom here, #.
This work is hard, but I must not complain.
The very air is foul here!
All these crops, and not a scrap for us to eat...
Maybe... maybe one day I shall be free.
Truly, #, the strength of Men has failed.
You men of the darkness are worse than the foulest Morgul-scum.
I have lived on these farms, and it seems I shall die on these farms.

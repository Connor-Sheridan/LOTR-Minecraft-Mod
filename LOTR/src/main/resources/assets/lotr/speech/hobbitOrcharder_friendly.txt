Good day, #.
Good day!
Welcome to my orchard, #!
And how are you on this fine day, #?
I have enough fruit to feed half the Shire!
Do you want to buy any fruits of the orchard, #?
If you cut down any trees, please replant them!
These fruits are so tasty!
Got any silver coins? I have some fine produce for sale.
I hope you're not trespassing!

Uruk-hai like silver coins as much as the next race, you know...
Bring me coins if you want equipment, filth!.
So you have proven yourself, #. Now we can trade.
A nice little stinking sum of silver coins might be nice.
If you want to trade, bring some coins, and keep it quiet.
I can never have enough silver coins, maggot!
I might be interested in buying some materials.
Certain materials can fetch a good price among traders like myself.
What do you want, maggot?

Can we trust you, #?
If you wish to lead my elves into battle, you must increase your standing among our people.
Only the greatest of elf-friends may fight alongside us in battle.
No elf would follow one as young in deeds as you into war, #.
Prove beyond doubt your allegiance to the elves, #, and we will fight with you.
We elves do not go idly to war, #.
You, #, would seek to command my warriors? By the Valar! Does the arrogance of men know no end?

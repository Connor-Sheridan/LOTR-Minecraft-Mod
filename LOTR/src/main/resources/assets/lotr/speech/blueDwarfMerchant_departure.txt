Well, I'll be on my way soon enough.
I can't stay here forever. Other lands to visit, other goods to trade...
If you wish to trade with me, you would be wise to hurry!
The riches of the Blue Mountains shall not wait here forever.
This is your last chance to get an excellent dwarvish bargain!
I shall be leaving soon, but there is still time for a trade or two!

I cannot allow a stranger to hire my warriors, #.
Who are you? Are you a friend of Harad, or an ally of Gondor?
Until you have proven your allegiance with us, we will not fight for you, #.
Do you fight with us, or against us?
Who is your master, #?
You must perform great deeds in the name of the Haradrim if you wish to command our warriors.

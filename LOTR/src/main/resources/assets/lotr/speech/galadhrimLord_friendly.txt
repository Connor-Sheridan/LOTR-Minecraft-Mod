I have many fine warriors for hire, #.
Do you seek to command the forces of Lothl√≥rien?
Have you any silver coins, #?
If you fight for a noble cause, then my forces will support you.
Even our elven warriors require payment, #.
There are few in Middle-earth who can match the prowess of an elf in battle.
You seek to form an alliance with the elves? Such a thing is rare indeed since the changing of the world.
May the grace of the Valar watch over you in battle.

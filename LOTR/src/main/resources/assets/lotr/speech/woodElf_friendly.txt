Welcome to the land of the Elvenking, #.
Welcome to our woodland realm.
Let us drink wine and be merry together!
What tidings from the world of men, #?
Greenwood of old this forest was called... but now a shadow lies over it.
Beware the spawn of Ungoliant!
Take care in the woods, #. You might lose your way...
Do not wander too deeply into the forest, #, for evil things lurk within.
What business brings you to these lands, #?
We elves of the Woodland Realm must remain vigilant, for there is always evil on our borders.
Always we must be on the watch, #.
The land beyond our borders is rife with corruption. But it was not always so...
Beware the waters of these lands! A powerful enchantment flows within them.
Old fat spider spinning in a tree! Old fat spider can't see me!
Ah, the wine of Dorwinion... the sweetest liquor that did ever pass my lips.
The bows of Mirkwood are swifter than all others.
We are the Silvan elves of the Woodland Realm.

My duty is to my captain # and the lands over which I stand guard.
The Morgul-filth of the night shall perish before us!
I have sworn to defend the lands of the free peoples, and defend them I shall!
May your journey be swift and your cloak warm, captain #.
By nightfall this land will be crawling with orcs.
Be on your guard, captain #. There are many enemies in these parts.
Long have we guarded these lands, captain #.
We Rangers have watched over these lands for generations lost to memory.
We Rangers remember the ancient lore of the West. We have ways to walk unseen.
The wolf that one hears is worse than the orc that one fears.

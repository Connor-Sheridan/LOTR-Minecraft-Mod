Please... help... us!
There is no escape from this darkness. There is no hope.
Man-flesh! Give me man-flesh! No... no! What am I saying?
He promised wealth... He promised power... He said He would let us go...
I cannot unsee it. I will never forget the terrible glare of His eyes. Please, let us go!
Help us! Please help us! We cannot endure anymore!
Who are you? How did you come here? There is no hope in this place. You will succumb to the darkness.
He took us away. He tortured us. He turned many into those foul orcs! He will not turn me! No!
No, no, no! This cannot be! You are just another one of His puppets sent to torture us! Leave us alone!
What... who... how? Do you come to free us from our torment?
His glare is ever upon us... you cannot escape it. You will die!
Flesh! I want flesh! Flesh! 
I must serve Him. I must obey Him. 
We must obey... We must serve...
The darkness shall consume you. You cannot escape it.
Do you come to torture us?
How could you enter the darkness of Utumno? There is no hope here. You shall soon join us in our suffering.
You shall fall, wretched creature of light!
Do you come from Him, to torment us further? No! I shall not allow it!
How many more thousands of years must I languish in these depths?
No light... nothing but screams and shadow...
There is no way out! None!
Your spirit shall linger in Utumno until the breaking of the world!

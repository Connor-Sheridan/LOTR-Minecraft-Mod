As you can see, #, my feet ache from this heavy load. Care you to buy something?
We dwarves do not usually trade with men, but you are an exception, #.
Ale, armour, weapons - you want it, it's yours, my friend! As long as you have enough coins...
I come from the mighty strongholds of the Blue Mountains, #. No other dwarves boast riches quite like ours.
I am travelling the land in search of wealth - perhaps you are doing the same, #?
Give me some coins, #, and I shall be a very happy merchant indeed!

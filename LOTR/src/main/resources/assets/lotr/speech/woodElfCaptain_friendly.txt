Do you seek to hire warriors? My elves might chance to follow you, #.
I suppose I could delegate some elven warriors to you - in exchange for a small payment, of course.
Have you any silver coins with which to buy the forces of the Woodland Realm?
We wood-elves are not cheap brawlers, #.
If you fight with us, #, then we shall fight with you.
There are many skilled warriors under my command.
We elves of Mirkwood, due to an incredible amount of threats, have become incredibly good at fighting.
It seems that you are an elf-friend, #. I shall allow you to lead my warriors.

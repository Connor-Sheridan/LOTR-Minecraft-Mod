Take your evil and flee these lands, #!
We do not welcome your kind here.
You should not have come here!
You are no match for the warriors of the Elvenking!
One way or another, you shall depart our lands!
You are mistaken if you think you can threaten us!
Flee, Morgul-scum!
Back into the shadows, you villain!
You were wrong to set foot here, #!

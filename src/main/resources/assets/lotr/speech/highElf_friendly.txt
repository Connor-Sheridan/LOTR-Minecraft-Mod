The world is indeed full of peril.
What tidings do you bring to the land of Lindon?
What tidings do you bring, #?
Moonlight drowns out all but the brightest stars.
To the sea, to the sea!
I long for the sea, #.
West, west away, the round sun is falling.
Our days are ending and our years failing.
Grey ship, grey ship, do you hear them calling?
Too long I have dwelt upon this Hither Shore.
Gilthoniel! O Elbereth!
Miruvor! Refreshes the body and cleanses the spirit.
It is easy to lose oneself among our folk.
Are you an elf-friend, #?
No evil shall enter the land of Lindon.
In this land, the last fair realm, the memory of Elder Days lingers still.
The days grow cold and the years fade.
The call of the sea in my heart grows ever stronger.
Soon... soon, I shall depart these lands, #.
Rarely have we spoken with men since the changing of the world.
You cannot call yourself a true elf-friend until you have tasted lembas, #.
A darkness is gathering in these Hither Lands. I feel it in my flesh.
The strength of the elves is dwindling here.
I have seen years of the sun beyond the count of mortal men.
How long shall I linger here, #?
Gil-galad was an elven king. Of him the harpers sadly sing. The last whose realm was fair and free, between the mountains and the sea...
Welcome to the last fair realm in all Middle-earth, #.
I feel that soon I shall depart these lands, #. To the sea, to the sea!
The time of the Grey Havens approaches. Do you hear the harbour calling, #?

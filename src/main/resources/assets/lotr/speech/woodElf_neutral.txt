Are you an elf-friend?
Are you an elf-friend, #?
Do you come in peace, #?
What tidings from the world of men, #?
Take care in the woods, #. You might lose your way...
We are slow to trust those who come from outside, #.
What business brings you to these lands, #?
We elves of the Woodland Realm must remain vigilant, for there is always evil on our borders.
Always we must be on the watch, #.
It is not wise to wander unannounced into our land, #...
Beware, #, for we wood-elves are slow to trust a stranger.
Your presence makes me uneasy.
Weak hearts are easily corrupted...
We are not like other elven-folk, #. We are more... cautious.
I cannot discern your intentions. You would be wise to leave these lands, #.

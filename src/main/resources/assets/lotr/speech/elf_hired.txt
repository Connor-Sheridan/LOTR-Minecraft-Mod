We elves are among the finest warriors in all Middle-earth.
It has been long indeed since the races of men and elves fought side by side, #.
Few can match the prowess of an elf in combat.
The Morgul-scum shall perish by bow and blade!
You have our allegiance, #.
I seek to defend all that is good in this world.
For Lothl√≥rien!
May the grace of the Valar protect us in combat, #.
Silver means little to an elf, #, but we fight for a common cause.

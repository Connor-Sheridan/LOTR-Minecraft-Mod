Come crawling back when you've proved your worth, weakling.
The stench of evil on you is not yet strong enough, #.
If you wish to trade, you must prove your worth among our forces!
I've seen more threatening halflings than you!
You want to trade? Come back when you're further down the path of darkness, scum.
Go and slay a few stinking elves, and then perhaps we can trade.
If you want any orcish equipment, you'll have to work more evil first.
There's no way I'm trading with a maggot like you!
Do you think the Lord of the Black Land just lets me hand out equipment to anyone, maggot?

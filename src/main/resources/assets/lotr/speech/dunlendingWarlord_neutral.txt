Get some more deeds to your name, #, and I might let you command my warriors!
I almost mistook you for one of those filthy Strawheads.
You'll have to earn some respect among our people if you want to lead us into battle.
And what do you want?
You are yet young among our people, #. Great men do not follow lesser men.
You want to hire some Dunlendings? Prove your worth first, #!

You may not cut down the trees of Fangorn Forest, young one!
They come with axes, cutting, biting, gnawing, burning, killing!
What do you think you're doing with that tree?
You have made an enemy of the Ents, young #!
No! That is not permitted in these woods!
Hroom, hroom. You shall regret that, young master #!
Hroom, hroom... what do you think you're doing?
That chop shall be your last, #!
These trees are not set here for you to slay, young one!
Cutting, splitting, killing... is that all you children of men can do?
Were it not for we Ents, this forest would be stump and splinter down to the last tree!

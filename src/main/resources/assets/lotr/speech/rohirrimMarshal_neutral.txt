Only those greatly respected in our lands may command the riders of Rohan, #.
If you seek to hire the service of the Rohirrim, you must first prove we can trust you.
You seek to command the Rohirrim? You are no great lord of Rohan, #.
Not until your name is sung alongside the heroes of yore may you command our warriors, #.
We cannot fight beside one so young in deeds as you, #.
Are you seeking to command the forces of Rohan? I have heard no tales of your great deeds, #.

The time of the elves is fading, but our strength is not yet gone.
I defend the elves of Lothl√≥rien.
Greetings, #.
We defend the free peoples of Middle-earth.
It seems you are a friend of the elves, #.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
How many orcs have you slain today, #?
The world is changing, #... I feel it in my heart.
If you fight for freedom, then I am with you.
Long ago, an alliance existed between my people and yours. Will you honour that alliance?
Ever stronger grows the sway of the Enemy over our lands.

A dwarf does not just offer to trade his wealth with any stranger who comes along!
If you want to trade, #, you'll need to do some more to prove yourself!
The wealth of the dwarves is surpassed by no other race, #!
You'll need to earn yourself a bit of a reputation before we can trade, #!
These mountains are full of riches.

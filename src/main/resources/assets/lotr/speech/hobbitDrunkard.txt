The road goes ever on and on...
Get off my ale!
Ring ding diddle diddle I de oh ring di diddly I oh!
Roll roll roll roll, roll-roll-rolling down the hole!
Heave ho! Splash plump! Down they go, down they bump!
But the only brew for the brave and true...
Hey ho! To the bottle I go!
I drink, therefore I am.
Tippity tippity tap! Splish splash splosh!
Fear! Fire! Foes!
My ale! Mine!
Do not turn me about so, #. My stomach is not constant.

What do silver coins and man-flesh have in common? I never have enough of them!
You want some mercenaries, #? I want some coins.
Get your fighting Uruk-hai here! Starting at just a few silver coins!
I want to get my stinking hands on some more silver coins!
My Uruk-hai are the strongest orcs in all Middle-earth!
Your foes will tremble before our Warg riders, #!
Bring me some silver coins, maggot!
I can build you an army worthy of Mordor!

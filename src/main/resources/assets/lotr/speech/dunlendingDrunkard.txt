You looking for a fight?
Oh ho! To the bottle I go!
You're a beautiful girl, #.
I'm just a poor boy, from a poor family.
Raaargh!
What did you just say about me?
Tonight, #, we shall feast like kings!
Hands off my drink!
Splish splash splosh! Splish splash plump!
To and fro! To and fro! Up we come! Down we go!

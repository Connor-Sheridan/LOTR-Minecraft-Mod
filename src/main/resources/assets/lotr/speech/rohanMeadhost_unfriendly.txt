No mead for you, scoundrel!
Get out of my hall!
I trade not with the foes of Rohan.
Get out, you brigand!
I shall serve nothing to you, #!
Leave now before I force you to!
You are no friend of Rohan, #.
What folly brought you here?
@ is not open to Rohan's enemies!
I give no service to criminal scum like yourself!
No! No mead for you. Get out!

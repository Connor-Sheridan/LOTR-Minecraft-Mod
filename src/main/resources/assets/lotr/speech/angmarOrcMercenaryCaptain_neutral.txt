You think I'd sell mercenaries to scum like you? Ha!
Only the foulest of men can command the Morgul-scum of Angmar, #.
Work some more evil, and then perhaps I'll consider trading units with you.
Come back when you've proven your worth, maggot.
I'm not selling any warriors to you until you kill some more filthy enemies!
The filth of Angmar would never follow a weakling like you into battle!

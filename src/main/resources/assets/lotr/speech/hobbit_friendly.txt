Short cuts make for long delays!
Good day, #.
Good day!
May the hair on your toes never fall out, #!
May the hair on your toes never fall out.
The road goes ever on and on...
Adventures? Nasty things, they are. Make you late for dinner.
Is it time for second breakfast yet?
Welcome to the Shire!
Welcome to the Shire, #!
The only brew for the brave and true... comes from the Green Dragon!
Where would we hobbits be without pipeweed?
Don't you wish you lived in a hobbit hole too?
Hobbit holes! Warmth, good food, and comfort.
It's a dangerous business, going out your front door.
And how are you today, #?

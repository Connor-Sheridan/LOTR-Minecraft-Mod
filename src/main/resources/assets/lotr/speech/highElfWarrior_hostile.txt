By the star of EÃ¤rendil, I swear I shall see you slain!
You are not welcome in Lindon!
You are not welcome in Lindon, #!
You may not set foot in this fair realm!
Flee these lands, #!
For Lindon!
Perish, you Morgul-demon!
No longer shall you darken these lands, #!
I swear by the Valar, I shall put an end to your evil!

Only the strongest friends of Gondor may command its armies, #.
If you wish to command the forces of Gondor, you must prove that we can trust you.
Are you friend or foe, #?
They say you are a friend of Gondor, but I cannot be sure until you have done more good.
One does not simply command Gondor Soldiers without gaining some reputation first.
You are not yet thought of highly enough to lead our soldiers into battle, #.
Show us that you can be trusted, #, and we will allow you to lead our soldiers.
